??????????


// Introduce yourself with console.log and template literals i.e. `I am an example of a template literal`
// ex. Hello! My name is obj.key obj.key < what keys should you be use to get your first and last name be?
// ex. The date is the obj[key] of currentMonth, obj[key]  < what key would you use to get the date? the month? year?
// ex. I am currently learning how to program in obj.key < What key would you use to get the programming language?
// change the value for programming language
// Add a console.log to output language
// ex. And I'm learning stringArray[index]
// ex. I now know how to make a variables and functions
// delete the random key/value pair
// exit the function
// call the function
// What is the value of currentMonth key?
// Using obj variable created at the begin, bracket notation, and the string variable with a value of "firstName" you made at the beginning of the script, what would the output be if we combined them?
// What would be the output of the random key/value pair that we deleted inside of the function?
