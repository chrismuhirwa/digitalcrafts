// Let's make a function that lets us know when we can go to the movies with our friend
// Create an object called myFriendsSchedule that has our friend's schedule; the key/value pair should be day_of_week and a true/false value i.e. { sunday: true }
function myFriendsSchedule(){
	const schedule ={
		monday:"true"
		tuesday:"false"
	}
	const myMoneySchedule={
		monday:"10"
		tuesday:"5"
	}
}

// Create an object called myMoneySchedule that has how much money I have during the week the key/value pair should be day_of_week and a number value i.e. { sunday: 10 }
// Create a function called canWeGoToTheMovies with a parameter that takes a string value; the value will be the day of the week
function canWeGoToTheMovies(schedule){
	if(myFriendsSchedule,myMoneySchedule){
       
	}
}
// create an if statement for myFriendsSchedule and myMoneySchedule
// Using bracket notation look up the day of the week for both objects, find out if my friend is free AND I have the money
??????????????????????????????????????????????
// If they have the time AND I have the money then we can go!
// ex. "On " + theDateWeWantToGo + "? Yes, lets go to the movies!!"
// Create an if/else to check if my friend has the time OR if I have the money
// If they have the time OR I have the money then we can go!
// ex. "On " + theDateWeWantToGo + "? One of us can go to the movies"
// Create an else
// if NEITHER they have the time AND I don't have the money then we can not go :(
// ex: "On " + theDateWeWantToGo + "? We can't go to the movies"
// exit the function
// Check 3 days of the week: each day of the week should return a "yes we can go", a "one of us can go", and a "no we can not go"
