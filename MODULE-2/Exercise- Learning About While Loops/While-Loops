// Let's check what day we can go to the Movies using a WHILE Loop
// Use the same variables from the other exercise
// create a function called canWeGoToTheMovies that has no parameters
function canWeGoToTheMovies(){
	const whatDaysCanWeGoToTheMovies : "";
	indexof = [0]
}
// create a variable called whatDaysCanWeGoToTheMovies that is an empty string; i.e. there is nothing inside the open and close quotes
// create an index variable with a value of 0
// create a variable called dayOfWeek that will have the day of week as we iterate over the array
// output/print the days of the week we are checking. What would we use to do that?
// i.e. We are checking the days of the week: daysOfWeek
// Create a while loop, add your conditional inside the parentheses
// create an if statement for myFriendsSchedule and myMoneySchedule
// Using bracket notation look up the day of the week for both objects, find out if my friend is free AND I have the money
// If they have the time AND I have the money then we can go! Add that to the whatDaysCanWeGoToTheMovies string
// ex. "On " + theDateWeWantToGo + "? Yes, let's go to the movies!!"
// change the value of index by adding 1
// reassign the dayOfWeek based on the index
// output/print the variable whatDaysCanWeGoToTheMovies
// exit the function
// call the function
